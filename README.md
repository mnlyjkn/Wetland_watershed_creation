# Wetland_watershed_creation
Takes DEMs and a wetland shapefile to create flow direction and flow accumulation rasters using Python and ArcMap Desktop 10.7.1..  Those rasters are then used to create stream features as well as watersheds.  Pour point features need to be created on the stream features before the watershed can be created.  The procedure is split into two scripts for that purpose.
